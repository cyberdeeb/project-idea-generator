# ðŸ’¡ What Should I Work On?

Instantly generate personalized and buildable project ideas tailored to your skills, interests, experience level, and availability.

## ðŸš€ Inspiration

This project was built as part of the **Boot.dev Hackathon** and inspired by my own journey as a self-taught developer.

Throughout my learning experience, I often found myself spending more time searching for unique and meaningful project ideas than actually building them. I created this tool to help learners like myself cut through the noise and get inspired faster â€” whether you're prepping a portfolio, hacking at a hackathon, or just trying to learn something new.
